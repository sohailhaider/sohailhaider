# Hi there 👋
Hey, it's Sohail Haider. I have worked as Team Lead/Senior Software Engineer at Synavos Solutions and Technical Lead Software Engineer at Averox Solutions Limited, making my total working experience of almost five years in web technologies and SDET. Usually, I would be developing the components for the team to follow up. I'm a big-time fan of SOLID principles. I'm currently leading a team of almost 26 professionals on different project usually developed with nodejs and php technologies and actively working on how to improve our project performaces for better scaleability.I excell in both frontend(react) and backend technologies(GraphQL/Restful) but I'm big time fan of TDD and personally preffers to work on backend. Prisma is my fav ORM to use with docker and bit biased towards GraphQL. Do hit me up if you are interested in exploring which backend technologies suites your needs best whether graphql or rest or which tools suits to serve best your purpose.
