I'm currently leading a team of almost 26 professionals on different project usually developed with nodejs and php technologies and actively working on how to improve our project performaces for better scaleability.I excell in both frontend(react, angular) and backend technologies but I'm big time fan of TDD and personally preffers to work on backend. Prisma is my fav ORM to use with docker and bit biased towards GraphQL. Do hit me up if you are interested in exploring which backend technologies suites your needs best whether graphql or rest or which tools suits to serve best your purpose. Highly motivated working on open-source projects including CNTK, NDNsim and related projects, have my own repository on Learning algorithms like Apriori.
